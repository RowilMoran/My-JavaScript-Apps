# My-JavaScript-Apps
My collection of Vanilla Javascript apps.

In this repo you will find the following apps:

1) Games
  * Snake Game.<br>
        I used Html and javascript to build this game. Really good exercise to understand the HTML canvas. 
        
  * Teen Titans Memory Card.<br>
        A memory card game created with HTML SASS and Javascript.  
 
 2)API
  * MovieApp <br>
       With a friendly User Experience, this app was built using the moviedb api.  
 
 3)Tools
   * Save your resources <br>
      My favorite... This app was a great way to practice and understand DOM manipulation.
